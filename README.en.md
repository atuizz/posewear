## Features

- **Three galleries**: poses (multi-angle line sketches), outfits (by season and type), and portraits (face references, CC0). Every image has a Chinese description and an English prompt you can copy.
- **Search and filters**: search in Chinese or English, filter by category, sort, or pick a random image. Each item has its own static page for sharing.
- **Try-on studio**: upload a photo, pick an outfit and a pose, then generate. You can also generate without a photo. It supports several outputs per run, a before/after slider, and single or zip download.
- **Generation history**: stored locally in IndexedDB. You can view, delete or clear items, and undo.
- **Clear errors**: an invalid key, a rate limit, a timeout or a safety block each get their own message and a suggested next step.
- **Reduce false safety blocks**: on by default. The studio rewrites its prompt into a neutral e-commerce try-on description without changing the outfit or pose. Turn it off to send the prompt as is.
- Favorites, recent items and prompt combos, all stored locally; an 18+ toggle with age confirmation; PWA and offline support; dark mode; a Chinese/English UI.

### Providers

| Provider | You need | Default model | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | API key (gpt-image requires a verified org) | gpt-image-1 | images/edits with multiple references; strictest moderation |
| Gemini | Google AI Studio key | gemini-2.5-flash-image | a.k.a. Nano Banana |
| Doubao Seedream | Volcengine Ark key | doubao-seedream-4-0-250828 | routed through the site proxy by default for CORS |
| Custom relay | Base URL, key and model | any | OpenAI-compatible; choose edits (multipart) or generations (JSON) |

## Quick start

You need Python 3.9+ with Pillow. Tests and deploys also need Node.js 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atuizz/posewear.git && cd posewear
pip install pillow
python3 scripts/fetch-assets.py   # downloads data and images from the original galleries (several GB)
python3 build.py                  # outputs dist/
python3 -m http.server 8787 -d dist
```

Set `POSEWEAR_RAW` to use a different asset folder, and `POSEWEAR_SITE` to set your own site URL for the sitemap and share links.

## Deploy

The repository ships without assets, so build locally first, then upload `dist/` to Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
npm install && npx wrangler login
POSEWEAR_SITE=https://<project>.pages.dev python3 build.py
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name <project>
```

`functions/api/proxy.js` is deployed as a Pages Function that only forwards API requests. Adding a rate-limit rule for `/api/proxy` is recommended.

## Tests

The Playwright tests mock every provider endpoint, so no real key is needed. They cover success, a bad key, rate limits, 5xx errors, timeouts, cancel, safety blocks and multiple outputs.

```bash
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
python3 -m http.server 8787 -d dist &
node tests/v12.js && node tests/v13.js
```

## FAQ

**Is my API key safe?** It stays in your browser's localStorage. Requests go straight to the provider. They only go through `/api/proxy` if you turn on proxy forwarding or use a custom relay; the proxy forwards requests as they are and never stores keys or images.

**Why was my image blocked?** Providers moderate both the input photos and the output. Real photos with revealing outfits are the most likely to be blocked, and OpenAI is the strictest. The rewrite option reduces false positives on normal outfits. It does not bypass moderation of prohibited content.

**Can I use the images?** No images are included in this repo. All assets belong to their original authors, so check each source site's terms. The portrait gallery is CC0.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. Run `python3 build.py` and both test files before you open a PR, and add screenshots for UI changes. Please don't commit any assets or keys.
